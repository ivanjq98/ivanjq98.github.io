        <p>Golden Neighbour project is to provide an extensive movie booking application and enhance how users interact with and enjoy films by providing accessibility and convenience for all movie goers. The user may easily create an account, login in securely with their email address and password, and users would be able to alter their login password at any moment for greater security. Users can swiftly browse through a wide variety of films, each with key information including rating, format (Digital or 3D), runtime and classification (e.g. P13, M18, R21).
        Users may choose available seats, add multiple bookings to a cart, and evaluate their selections before confirming a reservation using the applicationâ€™s booking capabilities. The process is designed to be intuitive and efficient. </p>

        <p>Sentiment analysis uses NLP to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral. To create a sentiment classifier for product reviews, one would need to collect labeled data, preprocess it, extract features, select a suitable model (such as Naive Bayes, SVM, or RNN), train, evaluate, and then deploy the model. The effectiveness of the sentiment classifier heavily relies on the quality of the data, feature selection, and the chosen model.</p>

        <p>The P2P trading enabled mutual beneficial interactions among prosumers and consumers for energy exchange. This allows prosumers to sell their power to nearby consumers without the requirement for a distributor. This system used the blockchain technology and consensus approach to ensure that every transaction was confirmed. The energy trading platform of this project was established to set up a local private blockchain. There are different types of approaches to setting up the blockchain network, such as Proof of Authority (PoA) and Proof of Stake (PoS). </p>
